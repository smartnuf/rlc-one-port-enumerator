# rlc-one-port-enumerator
We will develop some tools to enumerate one-ports from a given set of resistors, inductor, and capacitor (RLC components).

We were inspired by reading a book by [Morelli and Smith](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Passive_Network_Synthesis_An_Approach_to/IdyZDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 "See at Google Books"), and some of the references they site in their bibliography, to create tools to generate and count RLC one-ports of a given composition. We particularly want to know how many distinct one-ports there are for networks of 6 to 10 components of certain composition.
